# Runtime Systems

# About

For our project, we want to dig deeper into Python and Java and compare the two languages on different properties, such as performance, runtime, memory, productivity, etc.
To compare the languages, we want to implement more complex programs and algorithms. For instance, when looking at the differences by running algorithms like the Mandelbrot and n-body, big differences will be revealed between the two languages.
